## 🚀 Projects  
✨ Highlighted technical achievements and game development milestones:

### 🎮 2D Turn-Based RPG  
*Inspired by classic titles like **Suikoden***  
- Developed a full turn-based battle system with initiative order, elemental affinities, and combo attacks.  
- Custom class/rune system allowing character builds to evolve based on choices.  
- Branching storyline with persistent world states and multiple endings.  
- Built using a modular entity-component system with minimal runtime overhead.


### 🃏 Online Digital Card Game  
*Strategic PvP gameplay with ranking and meta-evolution*  
- Real-time matchmaking server using WebSockets and tick-based synchronization.  
- Deck construction system with rarity balancing and meta-tag synergy.  
- Built-in ELO-based ranking and seasonal progression system.  
- Full replay system and turn validator for anti-cheat and analysis.


### 🌲 3D Survival Game  
*Dynamic, living world with real-time simulation*  
- Procedurally generated biomes with voxel-based terrain and seamless LOD.  
- Crafting system driven by resource types, decay, and weather interactions.  
- AI ecosystem simulating predator-prey behaviors, hunger cycles, and adaptation.  
- Designed modular systems to support modding and world persistence.


### ⚔️ 3D Soulslike Adventure  
*Challenging combat and handcrafted world design*  
- Implemented stamina-based combat mechanics with I-frames, parries, and recovery windows.  
- Custom pathfinding AI with terrain awareness and multi-phase boss behaviors.
